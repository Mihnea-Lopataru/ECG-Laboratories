# ECG-Laboratories  
**Elements of Computer Graphics — Laboratory Repository**

---

## Overview

This repository contains the laboratory materials for the course  
**Elements of Computer Graphics (ECG)**.

The laboratories are designed to complement the theoretical content of the course by providing **hands-on experiments in Unity**, allowing students to explore and validate computer graphics concepts in an interactive manner.

All laboratories are developed using:

- **Unity 6 LTS (6000.3.6f1)**

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```

## Documentation (`Docs/`)

The **Docs** folder contains the **official laboratory requirements** for each lab.

For every laboratory:
- The task description
- Setup instructions
- Objectives
- Experimentation guidelines

are provided as individual Markdown files (e.g. `Laboratory 1.md`).

Students are expected to **read and follow the instructions in the `Docs` folder** when working on a laboratory.

---

## Unity Project (`Unity/`)

The **Unity** folder contains a **single Unity project** that includes the implementation for **all laboratories in this course**.

Important notes:

- Each laboratory is implemented as:
  - a **separate scene**
  - and/or a clearly delimited set of scripts and assets
- The Unity project is continuously extended as new laboratories are added

### About the Implementations

The implementations provided in this repository are:

- **More advanced than the minimum required solution**
- Intended as:
  - a **guiding reference**
  - an **example of good practices**
  - a starting point for exploration and experimentation

Students are **not required** to replicate the implementation exactly.  
Instead, they should use it to:
- understand possible approaches
- analyze design decisions
- experiment with alternative solutions

## Final Notes

This repository is meant to support learning, experimentation, and understanding — not to provide a single “correct” solution.

Computer graphics is best learned by **testing, breaking, observing, and refining ideas**.

Enjoy experimenting 🚀
